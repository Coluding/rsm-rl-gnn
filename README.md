## Optimizing State Machine Replication with Reinforcement Learning and Graph Neural Networks

This repository contains the code for ongoing research on optimizing state machine replication with reinforcement learning and graph neural networks. 
At its core lies the functionality to simulate a distributed system with a state machine replication protocol, and to train a reinforcement learning agent to optimize the system's performance.

Main part is the connection to the Java-based [BFT-SMaRt] system, which is a state-of-the-art implementation of a Byzantine fault-tolerant state machine replication protocol.
